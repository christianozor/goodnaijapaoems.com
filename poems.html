  <H1>"MY MOTHER BY BISI OLUGBOYEGA</H1>
  <P>It is pleasant to be born<br>
  It is important to live<br>
    It is compulsory to be fed<br>
    It is worthy to be bred,<br>
    It is fortunate to have a mother.<br>
    <br>
    I couldn't have been conceived<br>
    I couldn't have been born,<br>
    I couldn't have been bred,<br>
  But for my mother.<br>
    <br>
    In her bosom, she cuddled me<br>
    Sleeping or wailing she cuddled me<br>
    With soothing palm, she caressed me<br>
    Healthy or ailing, she caressed me<br>
    Cuddling, caressing depict her love.<br>
    <br>
    She taught me laughter when i cried,<br>
    She taught me love when i frowned,<br>
    She taught me tottering when i crawled,<br>
    She taught me babbling when i hooted,<br>
    Ser teaching last in my life.<br>
    <br>
    Laughter celebrates happiness,<br>
    Compassion celebrates love,<br>
    Tottering made me walk uprightly,<br>
    Babbling made me walk rightly,<br>
    I learn your lessons permanently.<br>
    
    <br>
    Mama Sweet Mama,<br>
    Sweeter than honey,<br>
    Prettier than gold,<br>
    More precious than diamond.<br>
    <br>
    Mother, oh precious mother!<br>
    Your loving spirit thrills me,<br>
    Your milk softens my heart,<br>
    Priceless mother, how wonderful you are.<br>
